I am a Ph.D. student of Computer Science at New York University (NYU, Courant) advised by Prof. [Jinyang Li](https://cims.nyu.edu/people/profiles/LI_Jinyang.html) and Prof. [Aurojit Panda](https://cs.nyu.edu/~apanda/).

My research interests are in Machine Learning Security and Trustworthy AI, in particular, explanability of the black-box models, adversarial attacks, defenses and poison detection. Recently, I'm interested in the explanation and transpacency problems in large language models.

Prior to strating at NYU, I was a pre-doctoral master student at University of Chicago(UChicago), advised by Prof. [Haryadi S. Gunawi](https://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~haryadi/), researched on applying deep learning models for storage system. Before that, I got my B.S. degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications(BUPT).
