  abstract = 	 {We develop a new, principled algorithm for estimating the contribution of training data points to the behavior of a deep learning model, such as a specific prediction it makes. Our algorithm estimates the AME, a quantity that measures the expected (average) marginal effect of adding a data point to a subset of the training data, sampled from a given distribution. When subsets are sampled from the uniform distribution, the AME reduces to the well-known Shapley value. Our approach is inspired by causal inference and randomized experiments: we sample different subsets of the training data to train multiple submodels, and evaluate each submodel’s behavior. We then use a LASSO regression to jointly estimate the AME of each data point, based on the subset compositions. Under sparsity assumptions ($k \ll N$ datapoints have large AME), our estimator requires only $O(k\log N)$ randomized submodel trainings, improving upon the best prior Shapley value estimators.},

abstract = {Summary In order to suppress the interference in local area networks, this paper presents a Wireless Local Area Networks (WLAN) interference self-optimization method based on a Self-Organizing Feature Map (SOM) neural network model. This method trains the model by using original data sets as the initial vector set and using the whole Signal to Interference plus Noise Ratio (SINR) vector generated by the change of one Wireless Access Point (AP) channel as the basic feature. After the training, the SOM neural network can quickly locate the fault AP and optimize the network according to the changes of the network environment. Simulation results reveal that the proposed scheme can efficiently locate the AP where interference happens and optimize the interference with an improved user experience.

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
